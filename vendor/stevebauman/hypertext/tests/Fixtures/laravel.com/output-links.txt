For more information on Laravel's authentication features, check out the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/authentication">authentication documentation</a>. Authorization You'll often need to check whether an authenticated user is authorized to perform a specific action.

Don't be. Laravel’s Eloquent ORM makes it painless to interact with your application's data, and models, migrations, and relationships can be quickly scaffolded: php artisan make:model Invoice --migration Once you've defined your model structure and relationships, you can interact with your database using Eloquent's powerful, expressive syntax: // Create a related model... $user -&gt; invoices () -&gt; create ([ ' amount ' =&gt; 100 ]); // Update a model... $invoice -&gt; update ([ ' amount ' =&gt; 200 ]); // Retrieve models... $invoices = Invoice :: unpaid () -&gt; where ( ' amount ' , ' &gt;= ' , 100 ) -&gt; get (); // Rich API for model interactions... $invoices -&gt;each-&gt; pay (); <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent">Learn more</a> Database Migrations Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share your application's database schema definition: public function up () : void { Schema :: create ( ' flights ' , function ( Blueprint $table ) { $table -&gt; uuid () -&gt; primary (); $table -&gt; foreignUuid ( ' airline_id ' ) -&gt; constrained (); $table -&gt; string ( ' name ' ); $table -&gt; timestamps (); }); } <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/migrations">Learn more</a> Validation Laravel has over 90 powerful, built-in validation rules and, using Laravel Precognition, can provide live validation on your frontend: public function update ( Request $request ) { $validated = $request -&gt; validate ([ ' email ' =&gt; ' required|email|unique:users ' , ' password ' =&gt; Password :: required () -&gt; min ( 8 ) -&gt; uncompromised (), ]); $request -&gt; user () -&gt; update ( $validated ); } <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/validation">Learn more</a> Notifications &amp; Mail Use Laravel to quickly send beautifully styled notifications to your users via email, Slack, SMS, in-app, and more: php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid Once you have generated a notification, you can easily send the message to one of your application's users: $user -&gt; notify ( new InvoicePaid ( $invoice )); <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/notifications">Learn more</a> File Storage Laravel provides a robust filesystem abstraction layer, providing a single, unified API for interacting with local filesystems and cloud based filesystems like Amazon S3: $path = $request -&gt; file ( ' avatar ' ) -&gt; store ( ' s3 ' ); Regardless of where your files are stored, interact with them using Laravel's simple, elegant syntax: $content = Storage :: get ( ' photo.jpg ' ); Storage :: put ( ' photo.jpg ' , $content ); <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem">Learn more</a> Job Queues Laravel lets you to offload slow jobs to a background queue, keeping your web requests snappy: $podcast = Podcast :: create ( /* ... */ ); ProcessPodcast :: dispatch ( $podcast ) -&gt; onQueue ( ' podcasts ' ); You can run as many queue workers as you need to handle your workload: php artisan queue:work redis --queue=podcasts For more visibility and control over your queues, <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/horizon">Laravel Horizon</a> provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Laravel-powered Redis queues.
